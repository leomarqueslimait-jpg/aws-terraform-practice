# Terraform Learning Journey

Thank you for accessing my Github. Here you will find my Terraform learning journey where I make projects to better learn the concepts of Terraform and apply my AWS cloud knowledge/skills.

## Repository Structure

In each folder you will find a `.md` file where I outline my thought process and what I learned. This serves to showcase my knowledge but to serve as reference for myself, so later I can check and revise something.

## Learning Resources

I am learning using the **Lauro Muller course** as well as **HCL registry documentation**.

---

## My Learning Approach

I use Claude to ask questions about a concept that I am not getting it or to give me examples. I also use Claude to give me ideas of projects.

I then try to create them **without using AI**, and only use it when I have been stuck for a bit. I then ask Claude to explain to me **why** something does not work, instead of just giving me the solution.

## Documentation Process

The `.md` files starting in **Phase 4** are all done by me. I find that making them from scratch as I do these projects help me better understand the concepts instead of just asking AI to summarize what I did at the end.
